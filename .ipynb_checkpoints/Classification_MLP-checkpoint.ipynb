People failing while trying for a baby is common and typically less of a big deal than people accidentally getting pregnant believing they are unable to and also not wanting to. In other words, unwanted pregnancy with our model at fault would be the bigger issue than giving false hopes. On the other hand, the more realistic setting of this model in action is that it would advise anyone, where fertility could potentially be altered to go see a physician, so the model would not ever be blamed for an unwanted pregnancy anyways.\n",
